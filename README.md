# TCSS-A-360-Autumn-TrivaMaze
This is the group repository for the final project of the class: TCSS 360 B Au 21: Software Development And Quality Assurance Techniques. In this project, group members: Hana Bechara, Brandon Rosario, and Julie Kim have collaborated in creating a trivia maze game that is developed entirely in Java, using the JavaFX library for the GUI and the SQLite library for database storage of the trivia questions.
