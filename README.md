Trivia Maze
Final project of the class: CSS 360: Software Development And Quality Assurance Techniques. In this project, group members: Julie ChanJoo Kim, Brandon Rosario and Hana Bechara have collaborated in creating a trivia maze game that is developed entirely in Java, using the JavaFX library for the GUI and the SQLite library for database storage of the trivia questions.
